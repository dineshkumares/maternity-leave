        <h3>Which nations have federally mandated maternity leave policies?</h3>

        <p>In a study organized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), data was collected on 41 countries, including the United States,
          on federally mandated maternity leave. The United State was and is the <b>only developed country</b> that does not dictate any paid leave for new parents.</p>

        <h3>New mothers must rely on their employers</h3>
