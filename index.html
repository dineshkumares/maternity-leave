        <h1>Maternity Leave <span class="units">IN WEEKS</span></h1>
        <p>Currently, the United States is the only developed nation that has no federal policy for paid maternity leave.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <h3>Which nations have federally mandated maternity leave policies?</h3>
        <p>Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Estonia, and Iceland implement some of the most generous maternity leave policies in the world.</p>
        <p>In a study organized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), data was collected on 41 countries, including the United States,
          on federally mandated maternity leave. The United State was and is the only developed country that does not dictate any paid leave for new parents.</p>

        <h3>New mothers must rely on their employers</h3>
        <p>As a result, many new mothers must rely heavily on their employers to grant them paid maternity leave and benefits.</p> 
        <p>This bubble chart visualizes <b>maternity leave in weeks</b> for various companies and educational institutions. The data was compiled by FairyGoodBoss, a online platform for sharing reviews about companies by women, for women.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p><b>Netflix</b> and the <b>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</b> offer the longest paid maternity leaves among this subset,
        at 52 weeks each.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>On the higher end of the spectrum, we see companies offering 30 weeks of paid maternity leave or more.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>On the lower end of the spectrum, some companies, like <b>Starbucks</b>, only allow 6 weeks of paid maternity leave. This number also
          varies depending on the type of employee â€“ for example, baristas at Starbucks are granted a shorter maternity leave
          than employees in the corporate office.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>The average maternity leave duration for reported employers is <b>21.2 weeks</b>, according to the dataset provided
        by FairyGoodBoss.</p>
